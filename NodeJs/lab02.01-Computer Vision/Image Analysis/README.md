# Image Analytics

In this lab you will analyze Computer Vision API where image analytics feature returns information about visual content found in an image. Use tagging, domain-specific models and descriptions in four languages to identify content and label it with confidence.

Note:Please refer the following link for more information[Computer Vision API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/).

### Prerequisites
The following software environment is needed for running this API :

```
1.Node.js
```

### Collecting the keys

Over the course of this lab, we will collect various keys. It is recommended that you save all of them in a text file, so you can easily access them throughout the workshop.keys:

```
-Computer Vision API subscription key
```


### Implementation

To check implementation of this lab please refer to the following file in this path Cognitive-Services-AI-Virtual-Trail-Blazer-Series\Node.js\Day 2\lab02.01-Computer Vision\Image Analysis:

```
                             imageanalysis.js
```

### Check implementation through following steps

1.open .env file in the Landmark Recognition folder then paste Computer Vision API subscription key.


2.Open command prompt (cmd) and set path to Image Analysis folder then run imageanalysis.js file using command below:
```
                               node imageanalysis.js
```

3.The following image is set for test in this path :Cognitive-Services-AI-Virtual-Trail-Blazer-Series\Node.js\Day 2\lab02.01-Computer Vision\Image Analysis\images
