# Landmark Recognition 

In this lab you will analyze Computer Vision API Recognize more than 9,000 natural and manmade landmarks from around the world.

Note:Please refer the following link for more information[Computer Vision API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/).

### Prerequisites
The following software environment is needed for running this API :

```
1.Node.js
```

### Collecting the keys

Over the course of this lab, we will collect various keys. It is recommended that you save all of them in a text file, so you can easily access them throughout the workshop.keys:

```
-Computer Vision API subscription key
```


### Implementation

To check implementation of this lab please refer to the following file in this path Cognitive-Services-AI-Virtual-Trail-Blazer-Series\Node.js\Day 2\lab02.01-Computer Vision\Landmark Recognition:

```
                             landmarkrecognition.js
```

### Check implementation through following steps

1.open .env file in the Landmark Recognition folder then paste Computer Vision API subscription key.


2.Open command prompt (cmd) and set path to Landmark Recognition folder then run landmarkrecognition.js file using command below:
```
                               node landmarkrecognition.js
```
